    <h4>Description</h4>
		<p>
			<div>AgriBot is an automated robot. A web app is used to collect the information and displayed to the user like weather conditions and soil conditions as well as the number of seeds planted and planted areas. A remote is used to give commands to the robot.
      </div><br>
			<div>The main purpose of our Robot is plant seeds over large farm areas!!!!</div><br>
      <div>Using our mobile application, we can enter the row length as a parameter to the AWS server and the robot will fetch it, then using the encoders of the gear motors we can move the robot, that distance value. In that row, we can plant seeds with a gap. We can repeat this process autonomously. User can also decide the number ofmrows he wants. If the farm is really big, we can use GPS to track our robot roughly. Using this method, we can cover the whole area without using cameras or other complex methods.
