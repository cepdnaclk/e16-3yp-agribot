    <h4>Description</h4>
		<p>
			<div>AgriBot is an automated robot. A web app is used to collect the information and displayed to the user like weather conditions and soil conditions as well as the number of seeds planted and planted areas. A remote is used to give commands to the robot.
      </div><br>
			<div>The main purpose of our Robot is plant seeds over large farm areas!!!!</div><br>
      <div>Using our mobile application, we can enter the number of seeds we want to plant as a parameter to the AWS server and the robot will fetch it, then using the encoders of the gear motors we can move the robot constant distance and plant the seed, this process will run periodically automatically. In that row, we can plant seeds with a gap. User can also decide the number of rows he wants. When it is done with the row user have to control the robot to change to next row using mobie app controls. Using this method, we can cover the whole area without using cameras or other complex methods.
